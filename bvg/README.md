With your help we're making transit cool again!

We have lots of customers and even more data, but you are the ones with the great ideas. Let us create a digital customer journey that help people to buy tickets and join the biggest carbon dioxid saver community in Berlin.

We're looking for your ideas that help us to make our customer well-informed, happier and more satisfied with our current transit offerings.

## Challenge description

BVG is the biggest public transportation company in Germany. With about 3000 U-Bahn trains, busses, trams and feries we serve more than 3 million passengers a day. 
The overall goal of the BVG challenge is to increase the usage of mobile services and to foster customer loyalty to become a synonym for a seemlingless public transportation experience. You can tackle our challenge from two different angles:

### BVG Community
Create ideas and develop solutions to increase our customer loyalty, foster a BVG community identification and to increase sales. We would be happy to see concepts borrowing ideas from different areas. Some buzzwords which came to our mind are: Gamification, bonus programs, intelligent sales logicc and an integrated customer journey. We're looking forward to your innovative, crazy or even funny ideas and apps.

### Data Analysis
Use the provided data sources (in combination with other data sources) to create applications that create value for our customers. These applications could work by using the gps functionality of customers smart phones. 

Please think big and don't give up ideas that do not fit exactly into these categories. We're looking foward to see what you come up with sothat we can increase customer satisfaction and our brand image.

## DBOpenData Special

There is a special prize for the best combination of DB open data with the Data from the BVG.

## Dataset description

We're providing multiple datasets. Especially the combination of them should be the goal of the hackathon.

* VBB API: Here you can query the schedule. You can also query routes and filter the api request by specific parameters (e.g. only use U-Bahn Data)
* Utilization data: For the period from 2014 to Mid 2016 we're providing utilization data of our vehicles. They orginate from the counting systems and contain the count of people entering and leaving a vehicle at the stops.
* Sales data of the BV-App: For the same period we give out  data about tickets that were bought with the usage of our App. These data points include single tickets from a single ride to a day-pass.

Have fun!
