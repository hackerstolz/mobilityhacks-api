Hey folks, we're providing 5 iBeacons and 5 Eddystone Beacons from our Partner Kontakt.io. If you are interested in using them contact Alex MÃ¼ller (alexander.mueller@minodes.com or via Slack).

We will use  the Kontakt.io  beacons management platform. This is making the beacons really easy to configure with the use of their Kontakt.io [web panel](https://panel.kontakt.io/). However for many use cases you might not even need to configure the beacons properly. 

We came up with some mobility use cases that might benefit from use Beacon technology:

* Smart payment in public transportation. Pay at the end of the month based on your U-Bahn usage pattern that is monitored by the ticket app which tracks your rides with the use of Beacon technology
* Push traffic notifcations for public transportation. So if there is a delay in the bus you should get you can get a push notification, because we know with the use beacons in which bus you are.
* Smart check-in in hotels
* Complementary services during your travel (tourist attractions) are pushed to you depending on your position
* Find the Beacons Game for public transportation. If you find hidden treasures in the public transport space (e.g. train stations, U-Bahn station, or in the back seat of busses) you will get bonus points and can discover hidden places in your city. Make it a modern Schnitzel Jagd.
