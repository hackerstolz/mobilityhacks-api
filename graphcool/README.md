# Graphcool API

## TL; DR

Use Graphcool to build a GraphQL backend in minutes which works with any framework. Save valuable time so you can focus on your product and presentation.

## What Graphcool provides

You and your team want to hack away on ideas disrupting the mobility sector. At a hackathon you win by having a cool idea and an awesome presentation. However sometimes you need a backend to be able to fully present your idea.

Using a backend as a service you can save a lot of time that you can use on more important things such as preparing your killer demo or adding another feature.

If you have used a backend as a service before you know they can be a pain to work with. Firebase has a limited data model and Parse does not allow realtime subscriptions. Graphcool solves these problems by using new a technology developed by Facebook. Using Graphcool, you can leverage all the benefits of [GraphQL](http://graphql.org), for example the interactive experience of exploring the API:

The playground features auto-completion and a full documentation of your API enabling quick prototyping of your application.
