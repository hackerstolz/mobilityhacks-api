## Challenge Description
Help Europcar, the European leader in vehicle rental services and a major player in the mobility market, to make car rental more sustainable! The most of the global company carbon footprint is caused by their customers during the use of rented vehicles and more precisely by the emissions of the car. It is most important for Europcar to help them to reduce this impact!


These are some out of many possibilities you could think of to tackle this challenge:

- Influencing the customer's driving behavior/style (eco-driving) or the car choice
- Using the latest technologies to reduce the CO2 impacts, given that cars are becoming more and more connected with sensors and telemetry (fuel level tracking, acceleration, mileage, geolocation, ...)
- Make car rental more social or add the aspect of gamification because people are also more and more connected
- Rewarding the customers with the best effort to save CO2
- Optimizing the use of Europcar's cars and their itinerary (e.g. pooling, sharing)

## Goals

- Help us reducing the CO2 footprint of our customers (leisure and/or corporate), with an idea that makes them aware of their CO2 production or even actively helps them to reduce it.
- Use the technologies, concepts and approaches, you like to use for your prototype!
- Make it as easy as possible, and why not make it fun and social

Have fun ;)
