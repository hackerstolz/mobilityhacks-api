## Introduction

ERGO offers a comprehensive spectrum of insurance, provision and services. In its home market of Germany, ERGO ranks among the leading providers across all segments.

## Challenge background
Offering a good car insurance product will not be enough for the future – Strong price competition, rising online sales, contract management platforms and new technologies like self-driving cars etc. are likely to disrupt our business model.

We therefore decided to challenge this development and become the most innovative insurer. In our latest strategic review we identified three key objectives and already implemented measures focusing on our core business:

- **Utility**: Nearly everyone has a mobile device on hand. Why don’t we offer individual extra services via smartphone like telematics, travel advises or risk prevention? 
- **Transparency**: Nearly everyone uses apps on the smartphone. Why don’t we give our customer tools e.g. for mobile live claims, to put our customers in the driver's seat even after an accident happens? 
- **Accessibility**: Nearly everyone uses Whatsapp, Facebook or E-Mail. Why don’t we use Chat bots to communicate directly with our customers?

We see these initiatives as "fixing the basics". This is only a first step to become a more innovative insurer. 

## Challenge goal 
Help ERGO to take the next step in becoming the insurer of the future! Develop a solution to increase the relevance in our customer's daily lives – Ideally also contributing to our key objectives: utility, transparency and accessibility. And don’t think about core insurance products only, think also about services, new technologies and innovations related to new mobility solutions.
